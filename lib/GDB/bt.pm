=head1 DESCRIPTION

If your perl program segfaults you can easily extract C<C> backtraces, however perl bactraces are
not available. Usually you can I<guess> correctly them (e.g. from logs), but that takes time
and it is error-prone. The proposed script solves at least partially solves the problem.

The script target audience is: XS-modules writers and bug-reporters (for perl core and XS-modules).

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Currently it was tested on the following configurations:

=over

=item 5.30 (non threaded, linux)

=item 5.32 (non-threaded, linux)

=back

=head1 INTERNALS

The main script is written in Python, as gdb out of the box has official Python-bindings.
To extend it, you should look a the perl sources somewhere around C<pp_ctl.c / caller_cx>
and duplicate the code in the Python script. Yes, you have to expand all perl macroses,
undocumented perl internals etc., to let it work. There is no other way.
